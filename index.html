        <li><strong>2008 - 2010</strong> I attended <strong>NWTC Marinette</strong> where I Partook in computer support
            specialist courses until funding became an issue and later I realized what I would be doing day in and out
            and that wasnt what I was interested in so I left the course.</li>

    <p>I have never really had any drive for a <strong><em>"career"</em></strong> but being blessed with the most amazing son I could've ever asked for has shown me a new light on life and that to give him an amazing future I need to step up from being comfortable to becoming amazing myself!</p>

    <p>With this much under my belt already I can do quite a few of the basic things and i can read <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em> rather well, but i dont <strong><em>understand</em></strong> it the best yet, syntactically atleast.</p>
